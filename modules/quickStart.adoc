= Quick Start Instructions

These are the instructions for skill builders who have never worked with the Cake Walk skill.

== Understand Cake Walk

Cake Walk is a simple skill which changes between usages. The initial experience is Alexa welcoming you and requesting for your birthday. It uses auto-delegation to get each of these slots. These are stored in persistent memory (S3) and the skill session ends.

On opening Cake Walk after you entered your birthday, you are either greeted with a countdown to your birthday, or if it's your birthday, you get a birthday message.

To build your own cake walk skill, go to the https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-first-skill[Cake Walk code repo on github]. Once you are here, you can will need the https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-first-skill/tree/master/final[final module code uploaded to developer console]. Clone the repository if you are familiar with git, but it's not necessary, because you want to set the files up in your Alexa Developer account. 

A. Open the https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask[developer console to the ASK page]. Sign in if needed.
B. Click Create skill.
C. Enter the skill name as "Cake Walk".

D. Upload the interaction model https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-first-skill/master/final/en-US.json[from here] to your skill. This is easy to do from the build tab. Copy paste the raw github link JSON into the "JSON Editor" which you can find on the left side.
E. Build your interaction model with the "Build Model" button.
F. For the code, switch to the code tab in the developer console.
G. Replace the contents of index.js with the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-first-skill/master/final/index.js[contents in Github from here]. 
H. Replace the contents of the package.json file with the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-first-skill/master/final/package.json[contents in Github from here].
I. Save and deploy the code.
J. Go to the test tab and enable the skill in "Development" stage.
K. Test the skill by typing `open cake walk` into the Alexa Simulator text box.
L. When this is all working (you'll see json in the request and response), go back to link:module3.html[module 3].
